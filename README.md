# Playground Scout
*A mobile app that helps parents discover, explore, and share insights about local playgrounds.*

## The Problem
As a parent of two daughters (ages 5 and 2), I understand how important it is to find the *right* playground‚Äîone that‚Äôs safe for toddlers yet still exciting for older kids. Is there sand, and should we bring sandcastle tools and proper footwear? Is the equipment in good condition? Is there a drinking fountain nearby?

Parents often struggle to find clean, safe, and age-appropriate playgrounds. Tools like Google Maps or city websites might show you where playgrounds are, but they rarely provide the **real-world details** parents actually care about:

- Is it fenced and toddler-friendly?
- What‚Äôs the surface type ‚Äî sand, gravel, rubber?
- Is there shade? Benches? Splash pads?
- Is there a drinking fountain?
- Are there nearby roads, noise, or broken equipment?
- What‚Äôs the atmosphere like ‚Äî quiet or crowded?

Parents need more than a pin on a map. They need trustworthy, community-powered insight.

## The Solution

## Welcome to your Expo app üëã

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
